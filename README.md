# ðŸ§  Sleep Stage Classification from Single-Channel EEG

This project aims to classify human sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM) using deep learning models on EEG signals from the PhysioNet Sleep-EDF dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Preprocessing EEG data (bandpass filtering, 30s epoching)
- Two Deep Learning models:
  - `CNN 3-Head` with multi-kernel convolution
  - `CNN + LSTM` with fine/coarse temporal resolution
- Evaluation: F1-score, Confusion Matrix
- Streamlit App for interactive visualization and inference

## ðŸ§¾ Dataset

- Source: [Sleep-EDF Expanded from PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/sleep-edfx/1.0.0/)
- Channel: `Fpz-Cz` (EEG)
- Sampling Rate: 100 Hz
- Sleep stages: Wake (W), N1, N2, N3, REM

## ðŸ§® Models

### 1. CNN 3 Head

Three parallel convolutional branches with kernel sizes [3, 5, 11]. Outputs are concatenated before final classification.

### 2. CNN + LSTM

Combines local and global temporal features using CNN and two-layer LSTM.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sleep-stage-classification.git
cd sleep-stage-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
